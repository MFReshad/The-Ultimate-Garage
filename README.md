# The-Ultimate-Garage
This was an Arduino project in "CSE3216 -Microcontroller Based System Design Lab".  We created a garage to protect vehicle from outer damage. As this garage will have also have another advantages, those are it will have well security system, automatic positioning the vehicle, alarm.

## Objective
Generally in today’s homes have an attached garage to protect vehicles from external damages . Many types of external damage like precipitation, theft etc. An ordinary garage is not protected at all to resist all of the internal & external attacks or damages. So the aim of this project is to protect all these issues as possible.As this garage will have also have another advantages, those are it will have well security system, automatic positioning the vehicle, alarm & emergency call and can be control through phone. So we named it “The Ultimate Garage”.

## Social Values
While many of us worry about home defense, few of us consider garage defense. So, protecting vehicles in home garage is our primary goal and 
initiative. <br /> 
Many older garage doors have flaws that intruders can manipulate to enter the home. Older garage doors don’t lock as securely and have poor opener motors, making it easier to lift the door from the outside. So we will make a device which will keep the car safe and we can easily open the garage door whenever we want. This can be also done with mobile phone via Bluetooth. Because of the sensor detectors if the garage is in danger for an example fire it will alarm the security. It will also keep the car safe from theft.
